    "\n",
    "[PaleoSTeHM](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2148265&HistoricalAwards=false) is a NSF funded project under award 2002437 and 2148265, aiming to develop a framework for for spatiotemporal hierarchical modeling of paleodata that builds upon modern, scalable software infrastructure for machine learning. The developments of PaleoSTeHM framework are largely based on previous work by [Rutgers Earth System Science & Policy Lab](https://earthscipol.net/), for example, [Kopp et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014EF000239), [Kopp et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000663) and [Ashe et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118302130), which did not reflect modern software engineering best practices, making them challenging to use without substantial training. Therefore, PaleoSTeHM is desgined to improve this by everaging an existing, widely used machine-learning framework at the base level (pyro), and builtd to take advantage of current and future computational advances without modifications to the user-facing product. [pyro](pyro.ai) is a universal probabilistic programming language written in Python and supported by PyTorch on the backend. Hnce, PaeloSTeHM supports the auto-differentiation and GPU accelration properties from Pytroch. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will go briefly through the background theories of spatiotemporal hierarchical modeling of paleo sea-level data based on [Ashe et al., (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118302130). We will use paleo sea-level for illustration in this notebook, wheereas, the content for analysing sea-level data can be applied to any paleo environmental data. Some useful information about hierachical modelling of sea-level about data will be provided, including data, process and parameter level models. A detailed explination of data level model is included in this notebook with an illustrative example of modelling coral-reef based sea-level data."

    "\n",
    "Hierarchical statistical models, often implemented in a Bayesian framework, partition random effects into levels to clarify assumptions in statistical analysis. Based on the Bayes theorem, the conditional probability of the observed data, $y$, can be inverted from conditional probability of unknown parameter(s) or process(es), $\\theta$, given the data, $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood function, $p(y|\\theta)$ (also known as a sampling or data distribution), is the probability of observing the data as described by the parameter(s) or process(es) of the fitted model.  The prior distribution, $p(\\theta)$, expresses a priori beliefs about the unknown parameter(s) or process(es), before data have been observed, and $p(y)$ is the marginal likelihood of the data, defined as the probability of observing y averaged across all possible processes or parameters. The conditional, posterior distribution, $p(\\theta | y)$, is the resulting process or parameter distribution, given the observations. Becuase $p(y)$ is often intractable and is irrelevant provided the observations are static, we use the alternative form of Bayesâ€™ theorem that states the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior:\n",

    "In a simple hierarchical statistical model of relative sea-level (RSL), they separate the underlying phenomenon of RSL change from its variability and the noise in the observation process. By inverting conditional probabilities, hierarchical models estimate time series or fields with probabilistic uncertainty. Each level of a hierarchical model quantifies uncertainties separately, requiring careful consideration of sources of uncertainties. To analyse sea-level data, three levels are typically defined: `data level`, `process level`, and `parameter level`: \n",

Data level characterizes the relationship between RSL and the observed RSL data (instrumental and/or proxy), $y$, and incorporates measurement, inferential (e.g., from the conversion of a proxy's elevation to a distribution of RSL), and dating uncertainties (inherited from various geochronology techniques). It can be understood as the distributiuon of observing a specifc sea-level height at specific age, given the underlying latent process ($f$) along with measurement, inferential and dating uncertainties (indicated by $\\theta_{d}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Process level separates the underlying phenomenon of interest, such as sea level, and its variability from the noisy mechanism by which this underlying process is observed (i.e., data level). This process model incorporates scientific knowledge and uncertainty into the estimation of the true RSL process through its conditional parameters $\\theta_{s}$, which can be unobserved physical model parameters (i.e., Earth mantle rheology for a glaical isostatic adjustment model) or statistical model parameters (e.g., linear rate for a linear sea-level model) or hyperparameters (e.g., length scale and variance for Gaussian Process model). \n",

    "\n",
    "The data level of a hierarchical statistical model represents the relationship between uncertain observations and true RSL. The specific type of data and associated uncertainty determine the form of this relationship and hence the form of the data-level model. For spatio-temporal modelling of sea-level data, it can be represented by:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y_{i} = f(t_{i},x_{i}) + \\epsilon_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

For some data, other uncertainty sources (e.g., from tidal range variation) can also being added to $\\epsilon_{i}$. A common assumption for many sea-level studies is that $\\epsilon_{i}$ are independent and normally distributed, such that:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{t}_{i} = t_{i} + \\delta{i}\n",
    "$$\n",

Therefore the parameters for data level models can be represented as:\n",

    "You will find that two data models yield similar estimates for the sea-level change trend and rate, with the posterior distributions of the model parameters largely overlapping. However, there are some noticeable differences: a normal likelihood results in a posterior distribution resembling a normal distribution, whereas a uniform likelihood leads to a uniformly distributed posterior.\n",
