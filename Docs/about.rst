PaleoSTeHM is a paleo-environmental modelling faced API based upon pyro, a universal probabilistic programming language supported by PyTorch on the backend. Therefore, it not only supports probabilistic programming not also the auto-differentiation and GPU acceleration. This API will provide easy-to-use models to infer the spatio or spatio-temporal variation of environmental change from geological data, with tutorials that cover the background theories and hand-on practicals.
